# LeetCode & Chill 🍿
## Welcome to the Grind 💻

Hi Again, This is Santhosh, your friendly neighbourhood coder. Alright, let’s do this one last time. Let me explain my story one last time—this is my LeetCode & Chill store.
This repo is my 12-step program to solving LeetCode problems.

### 🛠 The Process:

1️⃣ Admit you have a problem.\
2️⃣ Write brute force.\
3️⃣ Cry.\
...\
1️⃣2️⃣ Optimize (maybe).

*Spoiler: It doesn’t always work.*

## 📂 What's Inside?

- **Solutions**: My attempts at solving LeetCode problems, categorized by difficulty.
- **Notes**: Some explanations, approaches, and gotchas I encountered.
- **Fails**: Because let’s be honest, debugging is half the journey.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- To track progress and see how my problem-solving skills evolve.
- To help others with different approaches and optimizations.
- To remind myself that even TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) is a learning experience.

## 📜 Disclaimer

- Some solutions might be ugly. Some might be over-engineered. Some might not even work.
- But hey, it’s all part of the journey.
